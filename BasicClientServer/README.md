# SUMMARY

The project only uses a simple server-client structure. When the server and client connect, the server receives a message from the client, and the connection is terminated.

## ATTENTION

If you are working on your computer only, you can run it with "127.0.0.1" or "localhost". If you want to run the client and the server on a separate computer, you should arrange the IP and check the port information.

## RUN

If you run the project on an IDE(Eclipse IDE used for demo), first run the client, then run the server. You will see the connection messages if the server-client is connected correctly. 
If you run the project on the command line, the commands what you need are below:

**Server:** <br>
``javac Server.java`` (to compile) <br>
``java Server`` (to run) <br>
**Client:**  <br>
``javac Client.java`` (to compile) <br>
`` java Client`` (to run)
